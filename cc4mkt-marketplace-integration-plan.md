# Integration Plan: Every Marketplace Concepts → Claude Code for Marketers

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Apply the Every Marketplace plugin system and Compounding Engineering Philosophy to create a comprehensive "Marketing Operations Plugin" for the course. This will teach marketers how to use Claude Code's plugin ecosystem while providing production-ready marketing automation.

## How to Use Marketplaces

1. Add a marketplace:
   /plugin marketplace add EveryInc/every-marketplace

2. Browse plugins:
   /plugin
   Select "Browse Plugins"

3. Install a plugin:
   /plugin install cm@every-marketplace

4. Verify installation:
   /help
   (See new commands available)

## Example: CM Plugin

Once installed, you get:
- /cm:plan - Campaign planner
- /cm:execute - Content generator
- /cm:review - Multi-agent reviewer
- Auto-invoked skills for marketing expertise
```

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes
