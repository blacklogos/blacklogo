## Budget Justification Framework

### Building Your Business Case

This framework helps you justify your marketing budget to executives and secure buy-in.

---

### 1. Link Marketing to Revenue

**Formula:**
```
Marketing Budget = (Revenue Goal × CAC) ÷ Average Deal Size
```

**Example:**
- Revenue Goal: $5M
- Customer Acquisition Cost: $10,000
- Average Deal Size: $75,000
- Required New Customers: $5M ÷ $75K = 67 customers
- **Marketing Budget Needed: 67 × $10,000 = $670,000**

---

### 2. Benchmark Against Industry Standards

**B2B IT Services Benchmarks:**
- Marketing Budget: 5-8% of revenue (growth mode) or 3-5% (mature)
- CAC: 10-15% of first-year contract value
- CAC Payback Period: 6-12 months
- Marketing cost per SQL: $500-$1,500
- SQL to Opportunity conversion: 30-40%
- Opportunity to Close: 25-35%

**Your Position:**
| Metric | Your Current | Industry Benchmark | Your Target |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Budget % of Revenue | X% | 5-8% | X% |
| CAC | $X,XXX | $10-15K | $X,XXX |
| CAC Payback | X months | 6-12 months | X months |
| Cost per SQL | $XXX | $500-1,500 | $XXX |

---

### 3. Show Historical Performance

**Past Performance Justifies Future Investment:**

| Year | Marketing Budget | SQLs Generated | Revenue Influenced | ROI |
|------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|-----|
| 2022 | $XXX,XXX | XXX | $X.XM | X:1 |
| 2023 | $XXX,XXX | XXX | $X.XM | X:1 |
| 2024 (Target) | $XXX,XXX | XXX | $X.XM | X:1 |

**Narrative:**
"In 2023, we invested $XXX,XXX in marketing and influenced $X.XM in revenue, delivering a X:1 ROI. To achieve our 2024 revenue goal of $X.XM, we need to increase marketing investment to $XXX,XXX, which will maintain our proven ROI while scaling lead generation."

---

### 4. Break Down by Growth Stage

**Explain the Marketing Funnel Economics:**

| Stage | Volume | Conversion Rate | Cost per Stage |
|-------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Website Visitors | XX,XXX | - | $X per visit |
| Leads (MQL) | X,XXX | X% from traffic | $XXX per lead |
| Sales Qualified (SQL) | XXX | XX% from MQL | $X,XXX per SQL |
| Opportunities | XXX | XX% from SQL | $X,XXX per opp |
| Closed Deals | XX | XX% from opp | $XX,XXX (CAC) |
| **Revenue Generated** | **$X.XM** | - | **X:1 ROI** |

---

### 5. Scenario Planning

**Show Impact of Budget Changes:**

| Scenario | Budget | Expected SQLs | Expected Revenue | ROI | Risk |
|----------|--------|--------------|-----------------|-----|------|
| Conservative (-20%) | $XXX,XXX | XXX | $X.XM | X:1 | May miss revenue target |
| Baseline (Current) | $XXX,XXX | XXX | $X.XM | X:1 | Balanced approach |
| Growth (+20%) | $XXX,XXX | XXX | $X.XM | X:1 | Requires team expansion |

**Recommendation:**
"The Baseline scenario provides the optimal balance of growth and risk mitigation, requiring $XXX,XXX to generate $X.XM in revenue with a proven X:1 ROI."

---

### 6. Competitive Context

**Market Position Justification:**

"Our main competitors ([Competitor A], [Competitor B]) are estimated to spend $XXX,XXX-$XXX,XXX on marketing annually (based on employee count and market presence). To remain competitive and capture market share, we need to invest at least $XXX,XXX, which is in line with industry standards and our growth objectives."

---

### 7. Investment, Not Expense

**Frame as Growth Investment:**

**Instead of:** "We need $XXX,XXX for marketing expenses"

**Say:** "We're requesting a $XXX,XXX investment in customer acquisition that will generate $X.XM in revenue, delivering a X:1 return and supporting our goal of growing to $XM by [year]."

**Long-term Value:**
- Customer Lifetime Value: $XXX,XXX (based on X-year retention)
- Marketing Investment: $XX,XXX (CAC)
- **Lifetime ROI: X:1**

---

### 8. Risk Mitigation

**Address Budget Concerns:**

| Concern | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|-------------------|
| "Too expensive" | Show ROI and compare to cost of NOT investing (lost market share) |
| "Unproven" | Reference past performance and industry benchmarks |
| "Waste" | Explain testing approach, metrics, and optimization process |
| "Can't measure" | Detail measurement framework and reporting cadence |
| "Not priority" | Link marketing to revenue goals and growth objectives |

---

### 9. Phased Approach Option

**If Full Budget Not Approved:**

**Phase 1 (Q1): Foundation - $XX,XXX**
- Essential channels only
- Expected: XX SQLs, $XXX,XXX revenue

**Phase 2 (Q2): Expansion - $XX,XXX additional**
- Add growth channels
- Expected: XX more SQLs, $XXX,XXX revenue

**Phase 3 (Q3-Q4): Scale - $XX,XXX additional**
- Full channel activation
- Expected: XX more SQLs, $XXX,XXX revenue

"We can start with Phase 1 and scale based on proven results."
