        <h2>Creating Professional Campaign Briefs with Claude</h2>

        <p>Welcome to Module 2! Now that you've mastered the fundamentals, let's apply Claude Code to advanced marketing workflows. We'll start with one of the most important documents in marketing: <strong>the campaign brief</strong>.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>What You'll Learn</h3>

        </div>

        <h2>What Makes a Great Campaign Brief?</h2>

        <p>A campaign brief is the foundation of successful marketing execution. It should include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Executive Summary:</strong> Campaign at a glance</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>The Collaborative Approach</h2>

        <p>The best way to use Claude for campaign briefs is <strong>collaboratively</strong>. You provide strategic input and context, Claude helps structure, research, and articulate your ideas.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>Important Mindset</h3>
            <p>Claude is your strategic partner, not a replacement for your marketing expertise. You bring the insights, market knowledge, and strategic thinking. Claude helps you articulate and structure those ideas effectively.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Step-by-Step: Creating a Campaign Brief</h2>

        <p>Let's create a comprehensive campaign brief for FocusFlow's product launch.</p>

        <div class="step">
            <h3><span class="step-number">1</span>Start with Strategy Input</h3>
            <p>First, provide Claude with your strategic thinking:</p>
            <pre><code>I need to create a campaign brief for FocusFlow's product launch.

Here's my strategic thinking:
- Primary goal: 1000 trial signups in first 30 days
- Target: Remote team managers at tech companies (50-500 employees)
- Key differentiator: Team-wide focus time coordination
- Main competitors: RescueTime, Freedom app
- Budget: $50k for paid channels
- Launch date: June 1st
- Core insight: Remote teams struggle to find overlap time for deep work

Create a comprehensive campaign brief based on this. Include all standard sections and make it professional and thorough.</code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3><span class="step-number">2</span>Review and Refine Structure</h3>
            <p>Claude will generate a draft brief. Review it and refine specific sections:</p>
            <pre><code>The target audience section needs more depth. Add:
- Detailed persona (give them a name)
- Day in the life
- Pain points and frustrations
- Current solutions they're using
- Motivations and goals
- Preferred information sources</code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3><span class="step-number">3</span>Add Research and Data</h3>
            <p>Strengthen the brief with research:</p>
            <pre><code>Add a market research section that includes:
- Remote work trends and statistics
- Productivity app market size
- Competitor analysis summary
- Target audience size estimation
- Industry insights about team coordination challenges

Research this information and add it to the brief.</code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3><span class="step-number">4</span>Develop Creative Strategy</h3>
            <p>Work with Claude on the creative approach:</p>
            <pre><code>Expand the creative strategy section. Include:
- Big idea / campaign concept
- Creative territories to explore
- Tone and voice
- Visual direction (describe, not design)
- Message architecture
- Proof points and supporting evidence
- Calls-to-action strategy</code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3><span class="step-number">5</span>Detail the Channel Strategy</h3>
            <p>Get specific about execution:</p>
            <pre><code>Create a detailed channel strategy section with:

For each channel (LinkedIn, Google Ads, Content Marketing, Email):
- Why this channel
- Target audience segment
- Key messages tailored to channel
- Budget allocation
- Success metrics
- Example tactics

Format as a table for easy reference.</code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3><span class="step-number">6</span>Add Timeline and Project Plan</h3>
            <pre><code>Create a project timeline from now until 30 days post-launch.

Include:
- Pre-launch activities (creative development, asset creation, testing)
- Launch week activities
- Post-launch optimization
- Key milestones and deadlines
- Team responsibilities

Format as a Gantt-style timeline.</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Getting Feedback on Your Brief</h2>

        <p>Now for the powerful part - getting multi-perspective feedback. Ask Claude to review the brief from different viewpoints:</p>

        <h3>Executive Perspective</h3>
        <pre><code>Review this campaign brief from an executive/stakeholder perspective.
Look for:
- Unclear objectives or success metrics
- Missing business context
- Budget justification
- Risk assessment
- ROI projection

Provide constructive feedback.</code></pre>

        <h3>Creative Perspective</h3>
        <pre><code>Review the creative strategy section from a creative director's perspective.
- Is the creative brief clear enough to execute?
- Are there constraints that might limit creativity?
- Is the tone and messaging compelling?
- Are there opportunities we're missing?</code></pre>

        <h3>Channel Specialist Perspective</h3>
        <pre><code>Review the channel strategy as a digital marketing specialist.
- Is the budget allocation realistic?
- Are we choosing the right channels for this audience?
- Are the tactics specific enough?
- Are there channel opportunities we're overlooking?</code></pre>

        <div class="success-box">
            <h3>The Power of Multiple Perspectives</h3>
            <p>In a traditional agency, getting this kind of feedback requires meetings with multiple teams. With Claude, you can get diverse perspectives in minutes, helping you create a more robust brief.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Creating Supporting Documents</h2>

        <p>Once your brief is solid, generate supporting materials:</p>

        <h3>Creative Brief</h3>
        <pre><code>Based on the campaign brief, create a separate creative brief for the design team.

Include:
- Project overview
- Objectives
- Target audience
- Single-minded proposition
- Supporting points
- Tone and manner
- Mandatories (logo usage, brand guidelines, etc.)
- Deliverables list

Save as campaigns/focusflow-launch-creative-brief.md</code></pre>

        <h3>Media Brief</h3>
        <pre><code>Create a media brief for our media buying team or agency.

Include:
- Campaign objectives
- Target audience demographics and psychographics
- Media budget breakdown
- Flight dates
- Geographic targeting
- Suggested channels and tactics
- KPIs for each channel
- Competitive context

Save as campaigns/focusflow-launch-media-brief.md</code></pre>

        <h3>Measurement Plan</h3>
        <pre><code>Create a detailed measurement and reporting plan.

Include:
- Primary and secondary KPIs
- How we'll track each metric
- Tools and platforms needed
- Reporting cadence
- Dashboard requirements
- Success thresholds
- Optimization triggers (when to adjust strategy)

Save as campaigns/focusflow-launch-measurement-plan.md</code></pre>

        <h2>Advanced: Scenario Planning</h2>

        <p>Use Claude to think through different scenarios:</p>

        <pre><code>Create three scenario plans for the FocusFlow launch:

1. Best case: What if we hit 150% of our goal?
2. Base case: What if we hit our goal exactly?
3. Worst case: What if we only hit 50% of our goal?

For each scenario:
- What would cause it
- How we'd respond
- Budget implications
- Timeline adjustments
- Lessons learned

This helps us prepare for different outcomes.</code></pre>

        <h2>Real-World Example: Complete Campaign Brief</h2>

        <p>Let's create a complete, production-ready campaign brief:</p>

        <pre><code>Create a complete campaign brief for FocusFlow's Q3 launch using this information:

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
- Series A funded startup ($5M raised)
- Team of 15
- Product in beta for 3 months with 200 users
- 85% of beta users are daily active
- Net Promoter Score: 68
- Main feedback: "Finally, a tool that works for teams, not just individuals"

OBJECTIVES:
- Primary: 1000 paid trial starts
- Secondary: 50 enterprise demo requests
- Tertiary: 10,000 website visitors, 25% from organic search

TARGET MARKET:
- Managers of remote teams (5-50 people)
- Tech, marketing, consulting industries
- Companies that value deep work and productivity
- Currently using Slack, Notion, Asana
- Pain point: Can't coordinate focus time across the team

POSITIONING:
"RescueTime is for individuals. FocusFlow is for teams."

BUDGET: $75k
- Paid media: $45k
- Content creation: $15k
- Tools & software: $5k
- Contingency: $10k

TIMELINE: 10 weeks (2 weeks pre-launch, 8 weeks live)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Small marketing team (2 people)
- No in-house design resources
- Must integrate with existing company blog and website

Create a thorough, professional campaign brief that accounts for all of this.

        <p>Claude will create a comprehensive, professional brief you could present to stakeholders or use to brief an agency.</p>

        <h2>Template for Future Campaigns</h2>

        <p>Save time on future campaigns by creating a template:</p>

        <pre><code>Based on the campaign brief we created, generate a reusable campaign brief template.

Make it generic (remove FocusFlow-specific details) but keep the structure and include:
- Section descriptions
- What type of information goes in each section
- Questions to answer
- Tips for each section

Save as templates/campaign-brief-template.md</code></pre>

        <h2>Best Practices</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Tips for Campaign Briefs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start with strategy:</strong> Don't ask Claude to generate strategy from scratch. Provide your strategic thinking.</li>
                <li><strong>Iterate section by section:</strong> Don't try to perfect everything at once.</li>
                <li><strong>Be specific with numbers:</strong> Goals, budgets, timelines - specificity leads to better briefs.</li>
                <li><strong>Use multiple perspectives:</strong> Get feedback from different viewpoints.</li>
                <li><strong>Create supporting docs:</strong> Break complex briefs into role-specific documents.</li>
                <li><strong>Save templates:</strong> Reuse structures that work.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Exercise: Create Your Own Campaign Brief</h2>

        <p>Now it's your turn. Choose one of these scenarios and create a complete campaign brief:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>E-commerce:</strong> Black Friday campaign for a sustainable fashion brand</li>
            <li><strong>B2B SaaS:</strong> Webinar series to generate enterprise leads</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile App:</strong> User acquisition campaign for a meditation app</li>
            <li><strong>Local Business:</strong> Grand opening campaign for a coffee shop</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Include all sections we covered, get feedback from multiple perspectives, and create at least two supporting documents.</p>

        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Campaign briefs are collaborative - you provide strategy, Claude helps structure and articulate</li>
