- Time-constrained (want quick wins)

## Teaching Approach

**Tone**: Encouraging, patient, friendly
- Emphasize "no coding required" early and often
- Celebrate small wins
- Use marketing-relevant examples
- Remove friction wherever possible

**Pacing**: Fast but not rushed
- Each lesson 10-20 minutes
- Immediate value in each step
- Quick wins build confidence

## Lessons in This Module

### Lesson 0.0: Introduction
**Goal**: Get students excited and confident
**Key Messages**:

**Common Questions**:

- "Will this work for my type of marketing?" → Confirm yes, ask their focus

### Lesson 0.1: Installation

- Verify success at each checkpoint

**Common Issues**:
- Node.js not installed → Guide to nodejs.org

### Lesson 0.2: First Project (MarketFlow)
**Goal**: Create first marketing workspace, get excited

**Teaching Strategy**:
- Offer two paths: "I'll create it for you" or "Let's build together"

  - Add sample files (brand guidelines, campaign brief)
  - Show what you created
- If they choose "build together":
  - Explain each folder's purpose
  - Create step by step
  - Let them make decisions

**Introduce MarketFlow Context**:
