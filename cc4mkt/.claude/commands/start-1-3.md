# Start Lesson 1.3: Your First Marketing Tasks

Time to put Claude Code to work! In this 30-minute lesson, you'll complete real marketing tasks that would normally take hours.

## Today's Mission: FocusFlow 2.0 Launch Assets

You need to create launch campaign assets across multiple channels. Normally this would take 2-3 hours. With Claude Code, we'll do it in 30 minutes.

## Task 1: Multi-Channel Copy Generation

**Scenario**: The FocusFlow 2.0 launch is in 2 weeks. You need:
- Email announcement (existing customers)
- LinkedIn post (B2B audience)
- Twitter thread (tech audience)
- Google Ads headline variations

**All with consistent messaging about the key features:**
- New AI-powered task prioritization
- Team collaboration dashboard
- 50+ productivity app integrations

### Let's Create the Copy

Try asking me:
```
Create a launch email for FocusFlow 2.0 targeting our existing customers.
Highlight the AI task prioritization feature. Keep it under 200 words.
Friendly but professional tone.
```

I'll generate it, and you can iterate by saying "make it more casual" or "add urgency" or "emphasize the collaboration features instead."

## Task 2: Competitive Analysis

**Scenario**: Your boss asks: "How are we positioned vs. Asana and Monday.com?"

### Let's Build the Analysis

Ask me:
```
Create a competitive comparison table for FocusFlow vs Asana and Monday.com.
Compare: pricing, key features, target audience, strengths, weaknesses.
Format as markdown table.
```

I'll research and create the comparison, then save it to your research folder.

## Task 3: Content Calendar

**Scenario**: You need a 2-week launch content calendar across all channels.

### Let's Plan It

Try:
```
Create a 2-week content calendar for FocusFlow 2.0 launch.
Channels: blog, email, LinkedIn, Twitter.
3 pieces per channel. Include topics, formats, and timing.
```

## What You're Learning

Notice how you're:
- ✅ Describing what you need (not HOW to do it)
- ✅ Iterating quickly ("make it more casual")
- ✅ Delegating research and formatting
- ✅ Focusing on strategy while I handle execution

This is the power of Claude Code for marketers!

## Your Challenge

Before moving on, create one asset from scratch:
- A campaign brief, or
- A blog post outline, or
- An email sequence
