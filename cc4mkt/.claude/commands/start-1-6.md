# Start Lesson 1.6: Project Memory with CLAUDE.md

Learn how to give Claude Code persistent memory about your brand, products, and guidelines!

## The Problem Without Project Memory

Every time you start a new task, you have to explain:
- "Our brand voice is friendly and energetic..."
- "Our target audience is startup founders..."
- "Our key messaging is about simplicity and focus..."

This wastes time and leads to inconsistency.

## The Solution: CLAUDE.md

A special file that Claude Code automatically reads, containing:
- Brand guidelines
- Product information
- Target personas
- Key messaging
- Company facts
- Style preferences

**Once it's set up, I remember everything!**
