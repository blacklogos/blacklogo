# Start Lesson 0.2: Your First Marketing Project

Congratulations on installing Claude Code! Now let's create your first marketing project workspace.

## What We'll Create

I'll help you set up a sample marketing project called **MarketFlow** - a fictional project for launching a productivity app. This will give you a realistic structure to practice with.

## Creating the Workspace

Let me create the MarketFlow project structure for you:

```
MarketFlow/
├── campaigns/           # Campaign planning and briefs
├── content/            # All content assets
│   ├── blog/
│   ├── email/
│   ├── social/
│   └── ads/
├── brand/              # Brand guidelines and assets
├── research/           # Market and competitor research
└── analytics/          # Performance reports and data
```

## Let's Build It Together!

**Option 1: I'll create it for you**
Just say "Create the MarketFlow project" and I'll set up the entire folder structure with sample files.

**Option 2: We'll build it step by step**
I'll guide you through creating each folder and file, explaining why each piece matters for marketing work.

Which would you prefer?

## About the MarketFlow Project

Throughout this course, we'll work with a realistic scenario:

**Product**: FocusFlow - A productivity app for remote teams
**Your Role**: Marketing Manager
**Goal**: Launch campaign for the app's 2.0 version

**Target Audiences**:
- Startup founders (25-35, tech-savvy, need productivity)
- Remote team managers (30-45, managing distributed teams)
- Solopreneurs (28-40, wearing multiple hats)

This realistic context will help you learn practical marketing workflows!
