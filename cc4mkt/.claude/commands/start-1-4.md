# Start Lesson 1.4: Introduction to Agents

This is where things get powerful! Agents let you run multiple perspectives and tasks in parallel.

## What Are Agents?

Think of agents as specialized team members you can summon:
- **Brand Voice Guardian**: Ensures all copy matches brand guidelines
- **SEO Specialist**: Optimizes content for search
- **Data Analyst**: Interprets campaign metrics
- **Creative Director**: Reviews creative concepts

Each agent has specific expertise and perspective.

## Why Agents Matter for Marketers

**Before agents**: You review your own work, miss things, biased perspective

**With agents**: Get instant feedback from multiple expert viewpoints

### Real Example

You write an email campaign. Instead of just me reviewing it, you can ask:

```
Review this email campaign from three perspectives:
1. As a brand voice guardian (does it match our guidelines?)
2. As a conversion optimizer (will it drive clicks?)
3. As a customer (is it compelling and clear?)
```

Each agent provides specialized feedback!

## Let's Try It: Multi-Perspective Campaign Review

I'm going to show you how agents work with a real FocusFlow campaign asset.

### The Asset: Landing Page Copy

Here's a draft landing page headline and subhead:

**Headline**: "FocusFlow 2.0: The Ultimate Productivity Tool"
**Subhead**: "Get more done with our powerful new features including AI task prioritization, team dashboards, and 50+ integrations."

### Your Turn

Ask me:
```
Review this landing page copy from three perspectives:
- Creative director (is it compelling?)
- Conversion optimizer (will it convert?)
- Target customer (Startup Sam persona - will it resonate?)

Provide specific feedback and recommendations from each perspective.
```

Watch how I analyze from multiple angles!

## Parallel Workflows

Agents can also work in parallel on different tasks:

```
Launch three agents:
1. Write a blog post about AI task prioritization
2. Create 5 social media posts about the team dashboard
3. Draft a customer success story outline

Work on all three simultaneously.
```

This is like having a 3-person team working at once!

## Exercise: Your First Multi-Agent Task

Pick a marketing asset you created earlier (email, ad copy, blog outline) and ask me to review it from 3 different perspectives.

**Example perspectives to try**:
- Brand voice guardian
- SEO specialist
- Target persona (Sam, Maria, or Steve)
- Legal/compliance reviewer
- A/B test strategist
- Social media expert

When you're ready to create your own custom agents, type: `/start-1-5`
