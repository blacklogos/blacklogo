# Start Lesson 1.4: Introduction to Subagents

This is where things get powerful! Subagents let you run multiple perspectives and tasks in parallel - one of Claude Code's most powerful features.

## What Are Subagents?

Think of subagents as specialized team members you can summon for specific tasks. Each subagent operates in its own context window with specialized expertise:

- **Brand Voice Guardian**: Ensures all copy matches brand guidelines
- **SEO Specialist**: Optimizes content for search
- **Data Analyst**: Interprets campaign metrics
- **Creative Director**: Reviews creative concepts
- **Conversion Optimizer**: Maximizes conversion rates

Each subagent has specific expertise, its own context window, and can work in parallel with others.

## Why Subagents Matter for Marketers

**Before subagents**: You review your own work, miss things, biased perspective

**With subagents**: Get instant feedback from multiple expert viewpoints simultaneously

### Real Example

You write an email campaign. Instead of just one review, you can ask:

```
Review this email campaign using three subagents:
1. Brand voice guardian (does it match our guidelines?)
2. Conversion optimizer (will it drive clicks?)
3. Startup Sam reviewer (is it compelling to founders?)
```

Each subagent provides specialized feedback from its unique perspective!

## How Subagents Work (2025)

**Key Features:**
- **Separate Context** - Each subagent has its own conversation context
- **Parallel Execution** - Multiple subagents work simultaneously
- **Specialized Tools** - Different tool access for different subagents
- **Custom Configuration** - Define your own subagents for recurring tasks

**In this course**, you have access to 6 pre-built marketing subagents:
- @brand-voice-guardian
- @seo-specialist
- @conversion-optimizer
- @startup-sam-reviewer
- @manager-maria-reviewer
- @solo-steve-reviewer

## Let's Try It: Multi-Perspective Campaign Review

I'm going to show you how subagents work with a real FocusFlow campaign asset.

### The Asset: Landing Page Copy

Here's a draft landing page headline and subhead:

**Headline**: "FocusFlow 2.0: The Ultimate Productivity Tool"
**Subhead**: "Get more done with our powerful new features including AI task prioritization, team dashboards, and 50+ integrations."

### Your Turn

Try this command:
```
Launch 3 subagents to review this landing page:
- @brand-voice-guardian: Check brand alignment
- @conversion-optimizer: Analyze conversion potential
- @startup-sam-reviewer: Test if it resonates with Sam

Provide specific feedback from each perspective.
```

Watch how each subagent analyzes from its specialized angle - all in parallel!

## Parallel Workflows

Subagents can work simultaneously on different tasks, like having multiple team members:

```
Launch three subagents:
1. Write a blog post about AI task prioritization (1,200 words)
2. Create 5 LinkedIn posts about the team dashboard feature
3. Draft a detailed customer success story outline

Execute all three tasks in parallel.
```

This is like having a 3-person content team working at the same time!

**Why this is powerful:**
- Each task gets a fresh context window
- No context pollution between tasks
- Work completes faster (parallel execution)
- Specialized focus for each task

---

## Subagents vs. Regular Prompts

**Regular Prompt:**
- Single context window
- Sequential execution
- Context builds up over conversation

**With Subagents:**
- Each gets own context window
- Parallel execution possible
- Prevents context pollution
- Can have different tool access

**Best for:**
- Multi-perspective review
- Parallel content creation
- Specialized deep dives
- Complex campaign work

## Exercise: Your First Multi-Subagent Task

Pick a marketing asset you created earlier (email, ad copy, blog outline) and ask me to launch 3 subagents to review it.

**Example subagent combinations to try**:

**For Email Copy:**
- @brand-voice-guardian
- @conversion-optimizer
- @manager-maria-reviewer

**For Social Post:**
- @brand-voice-guardian
- @seo-specialist (for hashtags/keywords)
- @startup-sam-reviewer

**For Landing Page:**
- @conversion-optimizer
- @seo-specialist
- @solo-steve-reviewer (affordability check)

## Pro Tip: Checkpoints

New in 2025! Claude Code now has **checkpoints** - automatic save points before each change.

- Press **Esc twice** to rewind to previous checkpoint
- Or use the `/rewind` command
- Choose to restore code, conversation, or both

This is perfect for:
- Testing different copy variations
- Experimenting with campaign ideas
- Comparing subagent recommendations
