# Start Lesson 2.2: Content Strategy & Planning

Master content strategy - the systematic approach to creating content that drives results.

## The Difference Between Content and Content Strategy

**Random Content Creation**: Blog post here, social post there, no clear theme
- Results: Inconsistent, hard to measure, exhausting to maintain

**Strategic Content**: Planned themes, interconnected pieces, clear goals
- Results: Compound growth, SEO authority, efficient production
