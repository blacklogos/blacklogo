# Start Lesson 1.2: Working with Marketing Files

Welcome to file operations! This is where you'll learn how to organize, find, and manage all your marketing assets efficiently.

## What You'll Learn (20 minutes)

- How to structure marketing project folders
- Finding files quickly (even in large projects)
- Batch operations for multiple files
- Naming conventions that save time

## Interactive Exercise: Organize Your Campaign

Let's practice with a real scenario. You just received a dump of files from your designer and copywriter for the FocusFlow 2.0 launch:

**Files received**:
- `final_FINAL_v3.png`
- `email_draft.txt`
- `Copy for ad.docx`
- `banner_new.jpg`
- `social-post.txt`

**Your task**: Help me organize these properly!

### Step 1: Analyze the Mess
What's wrong with these filenames? Think about:
- Clarity: Can you tell what each file is?
- Consistency: Do they follow a pattern?
- Searchability: Could you find them later?

**Share your thoughts**, then I'll show you marketing file naming best practices.

## File Naming Best Practice for Marketers

Here's a proven system:

```
[date]_[project]_[type]_[variant]_[version].[ext]

Examples:
2024-03-15_focusflow_email_welcome_v1.html
2024-03-15_focusflow_ad_linkedin_hero_v2.png
2024-03-15_focusflow_social_twitter_launch_v1.txt
```

**Benefits**:
✅ Chronological sorting
✅ Easy filtering by project
✅ Clear asset type
✅ Version control built-in

## Let's Practice!

Tell me: **"Rename the messy files using best practices"**

I'll show you how I can batch-rename files and organize them into the proper folders.

## Your Turn to Try

After I demonstrate, try asking me to:
1. "Find all email drafts"
2. "List all files modified this week"
3. "Move all ads to the ads folder"
4. "Create a new campaign folder structure"

When you're comfortable with file operations, type: `/start-1-3`
