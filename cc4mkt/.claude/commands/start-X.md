## Part 1: The `/execute` Command - Parallel Content Generation

### Overview

Remember spending 8 hours writing copy for 5 different channels? The `/execute` command changes everything by generating content **in parallel** using specialized subagents.

### How It Works

```bash
/cm:execute --brief campaign-briefs/q2-focusflow-launch.md
```

**What happens:**
1. Reads your campaign brief (created by `/plan`)
2. Launches 6 subagents **simultaneously**:
   - @copywriter-specialist → Landing page copy
   - @email-specialist → Email sequence (5 emails)
   - @social-media-expert → Social posts (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook)
   - @content-strategist → Blog post outline
   - @seo-specialist → Metadata & keywords
   - @designer-brief-writer → Design requirements doc

3. Each subagent uses your **template library** automatically
4. All content generated in **parallel** (10-15 minutes vs 8 hours)
5. Output saved to organized folders: `content/q2-focusflow-launch/`

### The Compounding Effect

**Campaign 1 (No templates):**
- `/execute` takes 40 minutes
- Subagents start from scratch
- Generic templates used

**Campaign 5 (Rich template library):**
- `/execute` takes 12 minutes
- Subagents use your proven templates
- Brand voice perfectly consistent

**Campaign 10 (Mature system):**
- `/execute` takes 8 minutes
- Templates are fine-tuned
- Every channel optimized

### Real-World Example

```bash
# Execute with specific channels
/cm:execute \
  --brief campaign-briefs/q2-focusflow-launch.md \
  --channels email,social,landing-page \
  --tone professional \
  --template-version latest

# Claude launches 3 subagents in parallel:
# [1/3] @email-specialist is writing 5-email sequence...
# [2/3] @social-media-expert is creating 15 social posts...
# [3/3] @copywriter-specialist is writing landing page...

# ✅ All content generated in 12 minutes
# 📁 Saved to: content/q2-focusflow-launch/
```

### Practice Exercise

**Scenario:** You need to launch a webinar campaign. You have:
- Target audience: B2B SaaS founders
- Budget: $15K
- Channels: Email, LinkedIn, landing page
- Timeline: 3 weeks

**Try this:**
```bash
# First, create the plan
/cm:plan "Webinar: Scaling SaaS to $1M ARR" \
  --budget 15000 \
  --duration "3 weeks" \
  --channels email,linkedin,landing-page

# Then execute
/cm:execute \
  --brief campaign-briefs/webinar-scaling-saas.md \
  --channels email,linkedin,landing-page
```

**Expected output:**
- Landing page copy (hero, benefits, CTA, FAQ)
- Email sequence (invite, reminder, last-chance, thank-you)
- LinkedIn posts (15 posts: 5 thought leadership, 5 promotional, 5 engagement)

---

## Part 2: The `/review` Command - 12+ Specialized Reviewers

### Overview

The `/review` command is your quality assurance dream team. It launches **12+ specialized reviewer subagents** who analyze your content from different perspectives and provide **parallel feedback**.

### The 12 Reviewer Subagents

**Brand & Voice (3 reviewers):**
1. **@brand-voice-guardian** - Ensures brand consistency
2. **@tone-analyzer** - Checks tone matches persona
3. **@messaging-validator** - Validates core message alignment

**Technical SEO & Conversion (3 reviewers):**
4. **@seo-specialist** - Keywords, metadata, technical SEO
5. **@conversion-optimizer** - CTA placement, funnel optimization
6. **@analytics-expert** - Tracking, attribution setup

**Persona Reviewers (3 reviewers):**
7. **@startup-sam-reviewer** - Reviews from founder persona
8. **@manager-maria-reviewer** - Reviews from marketing manager persona
9. **@solo-steve-reviewer** - Reviews from solopreneur persona

**Specialized Quality (3 reviewers):**
10. **@accessibility-checker** - WCAG compliance, readability
11. **@legal-compliance-reviewer** - Claims, disclaimers, regulations
12. **@competitive-analyst** - Competitive positioning check

### How It Works

```bash
/cm:review --content content/q2-focusflow-launch/
```

**The Review Process:**

1. **Parallel Launch** - All 12 reviewers work simultaneously
2. **Specialized Analysis** - Each reviews from their expertise
3. **Scored Feedback** - Each reviewer gives a score (1-10) + detailed notes
4. **Aggregated Report** - Combined report with priorities
5. **Action Items** - Clear list of must-fix vs nice-to-have

### Sample Review Output

```markdown
## Campaign Review Report: Q2 FocusFlow Launch
Generated: 2025-11-15 | Reviewers: 12 | Overall Score: 8.2/10

### 🎯 Executive Summary
Strong campaign with minor improvements needed. Brand voice is consistent,
SEO is solid, but conversion optimization needs attention on landing page CTA.

### 📊 Detailed Reviews

[Expanded feedback from each reviewer follows...]
```

### The Compounding Effect

**Campaign 1:**
- First review takes 30 minutes
- Reviewers have no baseline
- Generic feedback

**Campaign 5:**

- Reviewers reference past campaigns
- "This is better than Q1 campaign, but Q4 had stronger CTAs"

  --content content/q2-focusflow-launch/landing-page.md \
  --focus conversion,accessibility

# This will launch only relevant reviewers:
# - @conversion-optimizer
# - @accessibility-checker
# - @seo-specialist (automatically included)
```

## Part 3: Auto-Invoked Skills - Intelligence That Compounds

### Overview

Skills are Claude's way of automatically loading specialized expertise when you need it. Unlike subagents (which you invoke manually), **Skills auto-invoke** based on context.

### The 4 Marketing Skills

#### Skill 1: Marketing Research Skill

**Auto-invokes when:**
- You mention competitors
- You ask about market trends
- You discuss target audience

**What it provides:**

**Example:**
```
You: "Help me research competitors for our project management tool"

[Marketing Research Skill auto-loads]

Claude: "I'll analyze competitors using the 5-tier framework:
1. Direct competitors (same solution, same audience)
2. Indirect competitors (different solution, same problem)
3. Adjacent competitors (same solution, different audience)
..."
```

#### Skill 2: Campaign Planning Skill

**Auto-invokes when:**
- You mention campaigns, launches, or initiatives
- You discuss budgets or timelines
- You talk about channels or tactics

**What it provides:**

**Example:**
```
You: "I need to plan our Q2 product launch with a $50K budget"

[Campaign Planning Skill auto-loads]

Claude: "For a $50K B2B SaaS launch, I recommend this allocation:
- Paid: $25K (50%) - LinkedIn Ads, Google Search
- Content: $15K (30%) - Blog series, case studies, webinar
- Tools: $5K (10%) - Landing page tools, email automation

..."
```

#### Skill 3: Content Generation Skill

**Auto-invokes when:**

**Example:**
```
You: "Write a landing page for our new analytics feature"

[Content Generation Skill auto-loads]

Claude: "I'll use the 5-section conversion framework:
1. Hero (Problem-agitation + Promise)
2. Benefits (3 key benefits with proof points)
3. How it works (3-step visual explanation)
4. Social proof (Testimonials + logos)
5. CTA (Primary + risk reversal)
..."
```

#### Skill 4: Brand Guidelines Skill

..."
```

### The Compounding Effect

**Campaign 1:**

**Campaign 10:**
- Skills know your brand deeply

---

## Part 4: Workflow Hooks - Systematic Quality Gates

### Overview

Hooks are automation triggers that run **before or after** Claude performs actions. They create systematic quality gates that compound your standards over time.

### The 3 Workflow Hooks

#### Hook 1: Brand Validation Hook (PreToolUse)

**Triggers:** Before writing or editing any content file

**What it checks:**
- ✅ Brand voice consistency
- ✅ Required sections present
- ✅ Terminology matches brand guidelines
- ✅ Tone appropriate for channel

**Example block:**
```bash
# .claude/hooks/pre-tool-use.sh

# If writing content files
if [[ $FILE_PATH == *"content/"* ]]; then
  echo "🔍 Checking brand guidelines..."

  # Check for required elements
  if ! grep -q "Call-to-action:" "$FILE_PATH"; then
    echo "❌ BLOCKED: Missing CTA section"
    exit 1
  fi

  # Check brand voice
  if grep -qi "revolutionary\|game-changing\|disruptive" "$FILE_PATH"; then
    echo "⚠️ WARNING: Avoid hype words. Use concrete benefits instead."
  fi

  echo "✅ Brand validation passed"
fi
```

#### Hook 2: SEO Checklist Hook (Stop)

**Triggers:** After content generation completes

**What it checks:**
- ✅ Title tag under 60 characters
- ✅ Meta description 150-160 characters
- ✅ Primary keyword in H1
- ✅ Alt text on all images
- ✅ Internal links present

**Example output:**
```
✅ SEO Checklist (Automated)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Title tag: 54 characters (optimal)
✅ Meta description: 157 characters (optimal)
✅ H1 contains primary keyword: "project management"
✅ 5 images have alt text
⚠️ Internal links: Only 2 found (recommend 3-5)

Score: 9/10
```

#### Hook 3: Multi-Agent Review Hook (SubagentStop)

**Triggers:** After `/review` command completes

**What it does:**
- Aggregates all reviewer feedback
- Calculates overall campaign score
- Creates prioritized action items
- Generates executive summary
- Saves review history for future reference

**Example aggregation:**
```markdown
## Review Summary - Campaign #10

**Historical Context:**
- Campaign #9 score: 8.1/10
- Campaign #8 score: 7.8/10
- Campaign #7 score: 7.5/10

**This Campaign (#10):**
- Current score: 8.5/10 ⬆️ (+0.4 from last)
- Improvement areas: Conversion (+0.8), SEO (+0.3)
- Maintained strengths: Brand Voice (9/10), Accessibility (9/10)

**Compounding Insight:**
Your conversion scores have improved consistently:
- Campaign #7: 6.2/10
- Campaign #8: 6.8/10
- Campaign #9: 7.5/10
- Campaign #10: 8.3/10

Keep using the CTA placement patterns from Campaign #9 - they're working!
```

### The Compounding Effect

**Campaign 1:**
- Hooks enforce basic standards
- Catch obvious mistakes

**Campaign 5:**
- Hooks reference historical data
- "Your Q4 campaign scored higher on SEO"

**Campaign 10:**
- Hooks provide strategic insights
- "This pattern has worked 3x before - recommend reusing"

### How Templates Evolve

**Campaign 1: Create baseline**
```markdown
# templates/copy/emails/product-launch-sequence.md

## Email 1: Announcement
Subject: [PRODUCT] is here
Body: We're excited to announce...

[Generic template]
```

**Campaign 5: Refined with data**
```markdown
# templates/copy/emails/product-launch-sequence.md

## Email 1: Announcement (28% avg open rate, 4.2% CTR)
Subject: [Use curiosity gap] - Performs 12% better than direct announcement
Body: Proven opener: "After 6 months of work..." (social proof) + "...we built something different" (curiosity)

✅ Works well: Leading with customer pain point
❌ Avoid: Feature lists in email 1 (wait for email 2)

[Refined with performance data]
```

**Campaign 10: Battle-tested system**
```markdown
# templates/copy/emails/product-launch-sequence.md

## Email 1: Announcement (32% avg open rate, 5.1% CTR)

**Subject Line Formula:** [Curiosity] + [Specificity] + [Benefit]
- Example: "We spent 6 months solving [PROBLEM] - Here's what we learned"
- Performs 18% better than generic announcements
- Optimal length: 50-65 characters

**Body Structure (proven 10x):**
1. Hook: Reference shared pain point (1 sentence)
   - "We've heard from 200+ teams that [PROBLEM] is frustrating"
2. Story: Brief development journey (2-3 sentences)
   - "After 6 months of interviews, prototypes, and testing..."
3. Promise: Specific outcome (1 sentence)
   - "Today, we're launching [PRODUCT] to help you [OUTCOME]"
4. Social proof: Who's already using it (1 sentence)
   - "Join 50+ beta teams already seeing [METRIC] improvement"
5. CTA: Single clear action (1 sentence)
   - "Watch the 2-minute demo →"

**Performance Data (10 campaigns):**
- Avg open rate: 32% (+8% vs generic)
- Avg CTR: 5.1% (+2.3% vs generic)
- Best performers: Added customer quote in hook
- Worst performers: Led with features instead of problem

**Compounding Insights:**
- This template evolved from 4 different approaches
- Version 3 (Campaign #5) introduced the story element - improved CTR by 1.8%
- Version 5 (Campaign #8) added social proof - improved conversion by 12%
- Current version has been refined across 10 launches

[Battle-tested, data-driven template]
